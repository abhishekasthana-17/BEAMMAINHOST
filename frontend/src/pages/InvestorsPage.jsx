          Beam Wallet is a marketing, loyalty and global payments acceptance
          platform with built-in support for smart contracts.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: "30px" }}>
          Rather than wasting over $5.2 trillion on payments fees, utilizing
          unmeasurable marketing and inefficient processes, we create Beam
          Wallet to allow stakeholders of the retail value to reward their
          customers directly.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: "30px" }}>
          The Beam Wallet is revolutionizing the cashback market around the
          world, not only as an innovative platform, but also as a blockchain
          with its own token, the Beam Token. This unique approach eliminates
          exorbitant fees and provides investors with a high profit opportunity,
          driven by the increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies and cashback.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our vision is to create a future where every product and service is
          perfectly matched to our needs and knows the customer it's destined
          for in advance. We are no longer wasting our time searching for
          products and services. And the retailers are no longer wasting their
          money searching for us. Instead, what we need and want find us at the
          right time, right place and for the right price.

          the sale of premium services, and strategic partnerships with
          businesses and merchants. This diverse and scalable business model
          ensures the sustainability of the platform and the continued growth of

  businessModel: {
    title: "Business Model",
    description: (
      <div>
        <p>
          Our business model is based on the volume of transactions between
          consumers and merchants using the Beam platform, assuming both parties
          recognize the advantages of using such system instead of others.
        </p>
        <p>
          With built-in supports for smart contracts, Beam Wallet enables all
          stakeholders in the entire retail value chain to exchange data for
          value without having to invest in a proprietary loyalty solution or
          spend any money upfront. And since multiple network participants are
          competing to unlock the value attached to smart contracts, the
          stakeholders will always get the best possible outcome in terms of
          effectiveness and cost efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          The added benefit of Beam Wallet as a payment method enables retail
          customers to earn and burn their rewards automatically as well as pay
          the balance of the transaction with another funding source in a single
          step.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beam Wallet is also a payments acceptance platform. All existing apps
          acting as Issuers and POS vendors as Acquirers are incentivised to
          process transactions on the network.
        </p>
        <p>
          The incentives attached to smart contracts on the Beam networks
          provide all participants with additional revenue streams and will
          therefore exponentially increase participation and adoption of the
          plataform globally.
        </p>
        <p>
          None of the participants on the network are required to get banking
          licenses or deal with settlements and proprietary point-to-point
          integrations. A single integration with the Beam Plataform takes care
          of all integrations, flow of funds and settlements between all parties
          on the network.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, the Beam system just launched an advanced incentive model
          to all stakeholders in the Beam Wallet universe, by issuing Beam
          tokens with the primary purpose of incentivizing network growth
          through appreciation of its value. You can see all the information

            As a disruptive technology that adds value to marketing, loyalty,
            payments and blockchain, 100% digital and green (plastic-free &
            paper-free), Beam Wallet has huge growth potential and unlimited and
            global scalability.
          </p>

          <p className={styles.moneyWorkIntro}>
            To the tremendous capacity that the Beam network has on its own, you
            also have to add the value of the Beam Tokens, which has been
            carefully designed to increase progressively over time:
          </p>

          <div className={styles.moneyWorkBox}>
            <p>
              <strong>1.</strong> As a direct result of a Local Partner's
              requirement to hold tokens, supply of Beam tokens in circulation
              will continuously reduce as more Local Partners launch Beam Wallet
              in more countries.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className={styles.moneyWorkBox}>
            <p>
              <strong>2.</strong> By increasing the size of the acceptance
              network using the Network Development Fund. This will naturally
              attract more users to the platform, increasing the number of
              transactions processed on the network.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className={styles.moneyWorkBox}>
            <p>
              <strong>3.</strong> Every transaction on the platform results in
              participants automatically acquiring Beam tokens from the market
              with the revenues they generate for their services on the network.
              This improves the liquidity of Beam tokens through constantly
              increasing demand.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p className={styles.moneyWorkOutro}>
            Whilst each of these factors operates independently, collectively
            they are designed to be synergetic, each amplifying the effect of
            the others.
